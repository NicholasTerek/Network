# Gradient-Based Neural Network in C++

## Overview
This project implements a neural network in C++ with custom gradient tracking using a `Value` class. It includes neurons, layers, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with basic gradient descent optimization.

## Key Features
- **Value Class**: Tracks gradients and supports arithmetic operations.
- **Neuron & Layer Classes**: Basic neuron with weights, bias, and activation. Layers group neurons to form a network.
- **MLP**: A simple feed-forward neural network with forward and backward propagation.
- **Gradient Descent**: Automatically computes gradients and updates weights.
